# NEO Locks
## NOTE: EXPERIMENTAL
This mod is still under testing for server stability. We've already had one glitch that broke freshly 
spawned locks. Hopefully, we'll have time to post a post-mortem on that one under issues in the future.
## Description
This mod is designed to allow admins to use icons on their CFTools map to get lock combinations or even unlock
them from the map on the CFTools website.  Running a PVE server leads to a LOT of player construction. In order 
to prevent CFTools map icons from overloading the map, there is a command to toggle show/hide locks and will 
only display or allowed to interact with locks that have been locked.
